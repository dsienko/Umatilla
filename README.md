# Umatilla Layout

This extension adds a Umatilla-Sahaptian keyboard layout to Chrome OS.

## How To Install

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`.
   1. Toggle "Developer mode" (in the upper right corner) on.
   2. Click "Load unpacked" on the top left.
   3. Navigate to and select the folder containing the manifest for Umatilla
      input and push "Open".

2. Go to `chrome://settings/languages`.
   1. Select "Language" and ensure "English (United States)" is listed or add
      it if it is missing.
   2. Select "Input method" followed by "Manage input methods".
   3. Select the box labeled "Umatilla".


## How To Use

A new icon should appear in the status bar of Chrome OS indicating which
keyboard layout is active. The default for "US Keyboard" will display as "US".
Type `Shift+Ctrl+Space` to cycle through the available language and layout
options. The Umatilla layout should be shown as "EN". Note that other layouts
using the English language with a custom layout will look that way as well.

Click the icon for a pop-up which will show all available layouts and which
is currently active. You may change layouts this way as well.
